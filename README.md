# OXYBASE_O2
Scripts for calibration and testing of the PreSens Oxybase Dissolved O2 RS232 sensor

Requires 5V power supply and USB to RS232 cable

Both scripts log data to the directory you choose to store the software.

Oxy_live.py will plot and log both temperature and pressure in real time for visual confirmation of sensor function
